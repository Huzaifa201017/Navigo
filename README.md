# Navigo

A native platform (Ios/Android) application, which provides the users the optimal route for his/her destination using the stations/stops of transport services.
For now, this application targets the three main transport services in Lahore, Pakistan, which are:
- Metro Bus Service
- Speedo Bus Service
- Orange Train

The optimality of the routes depends upon the following criteria:
- Minimum Walking Distance
- Minimum Total Distance
- Minimum Station Switching

Another feature of this application is that one can also view multiple routes to a destination. So all these features are implemented by this application.

## Use Cases
The use cases of this application are:
- Log In & Sign Up
- Find Route
- View Path
- Save Place
- Search Destination
- Browse Routes
- Find multiple efficient routes ( In the video below, the path is getting changed when we clicked on some edge i.e the blue line )
